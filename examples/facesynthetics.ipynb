    "Why wait for your data to download when you can stream it instead? Let's see how to do so with MosaicML [Streaming](https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming) and [Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is useful for multi-node setups where workers don't have persistent storage and each element of the dataset must be downloaded exactly once. Composer is a library for training neural networks better, faster, and cheaper. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate a streaming approach to loading our datasets, using Microsoft's FaceSynthetics dataset as an example, and we'll use composer for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you're reasonably familiar with the workings of datasets and dataloaders for training deep learning models. In addition, since we'll be building from a computer vision example, familiarity in that area will likely be useful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with streaming's dataset classes ([StreamingDataset][streaming_dataset] and [MDSWriter][streaming_dataset_mds_writer]), that's great. If not, you may want to pause while working through the tutorial and look at the docs referenced along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals and Concepts Covered\n",

    "1. Obtaining the dataset\n",
    "2. Preparing the dataset for streaming\n",
    "3. Streaming the dataset to the local machine\n",
