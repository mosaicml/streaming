# Sampling

You can choose how sampling from your dataset(s) occurs between epochs by specifying the `sampling_method` when instantiating `StreamingDataset`. Currently, this can take on one of two values:

-`'balanced'`: (default) Samples are chosen at random from dataset(s) during each epoch according to the proportions specified.
-`'fixed`: The same samples from the dataset(s) are chosen during every epoch, still according to the proportions specified.
