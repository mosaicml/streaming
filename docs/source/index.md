# Streaming

Welcome to MosaicML’s Streaming documentation page!  Streaming is a PyTorch compatible dataset that enables users to stream training data from
cloud-based object stores. Streaming can read files from local disk or from cloud-based object stores. As a drop-in replacement for your `Dataset` class, it's easy to get streaming:

<!--pytest.mark.skip-->
```python
dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset=ImageStreamingDataset(remote=s3://...))
```

For additional details, please see our [Quick Start](getting_started/quick_start.md) and [User Guide](getting_started/user_start.md).

Streaming was originally developed as a part of MosaicML’s Composer training library and is a critical component of our efficient machine learning infrastructure.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mosaicml-streaming
```

## Key Benefits

- High performance, accurate streaming of training data from cloud storage.
- Efficiently train anywhere, independent of training data location.
- Cloud-native, no persistent storage required; simplifying infrastructure.
- Enhanced data security, data exists ephemerally training cluster.

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for {class}`torch.utils.data.Dataset` datasets, compatible {class}`torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` style dataloaders.
- Built-in support for popular open source datasets (e.g., ADE20K, C4, COCO, Enwiki, ImageNet, etc.).
- Support for various image, structured and unstructured text formats.
- Helper utilities to convert proprietary datasets to streaming format.
- Streaming dataset compression (e.g., gzip, snappy, zstd, bz2, etc.).
- Streaming dataset integrity (e.g., SHA2, SHA3, MD5, xxHash, etc.).

## Community

Streaming is part of the broader Machine Learning community, and we welcome any contributions, pull requests, and issues.
