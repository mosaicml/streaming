# Installation
Streaming Dataset installs via pip. Installing Streaming Dataset in a virtual environment is recommended to avoid any dependency conflicts. Streaming Dataset has been tested on Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

## Create a virtual environment
1. Create and navigate to your project directory:
    ```
    mkdir custom-project
    cd custom-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment inside your project directory:
    ```
    python -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>

    # For example
    python -m venv venv_streaming
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    source venv_streaming/bin/activate
    ```
