class Phaser:
    """Keep or drop shard file phases, configured by intended use case and/or explicitly.

    Args:
        persistent (bool): Whether to cache the first phase of the file that its
            format uses. This is the phase used for persistent persistent and downloading, i.e, the
            phase required in order to serve as a Stream remote. It is ``zip``  if compression was
            used, or ``raw`` otherwise. Defaults to ``False``.
        medial (bool): Whether to cache any phase(s) between the ones used
            for ``persistent`` and``checked``, respectively. Currently, this would only
            select a phase in the case of compressed Streaming Parquet shards with a sized
            canonicalized form, but it is possible that phases may become more complex in the
            future. Useful if you want to keep all phases of a shard file. Defaults to ``False``.
        checked (bool): Whether to cache the last phase of the file
            that its format uses that is able to be checked on resumption, by having associated
            size/hash metadata set. For Parquet shards to be converted on the fly, we will not have
            any expected size or hashes for its last (i.e. canonicalized) phase. Useful if you want
            to not accept any uncheckable shard files you find cached locally upon init. Defaults to
            ``True``.
        active (bool): Whether to cache the very last phase of the file that its
            format uses, without regard to whether it can be checked or not. This phase is the
            final product of shard preparation. Set to ``True`` if you intend to use the shard in
            any way, and to ``False`` for dry runs of shard preparation, clearing a dataset to just
            the ``persistent`` phase of shards, or other such purpose. Defaults to ``True``.
        zip (bool): Whether to cache the ``zip`` phase of the file, if its
            format uses it. If ``bool``, it overrides what the intended use cases would do. If
            ``None``, it takes its value from from the intended use cases would do. Defaults to
            ``False``.
        raw (bool): Whether to cache the ``raw`` phase of the file, if its
            format uses it. If ``bool``, it overrides what the intended use cases would do. If
            ``None``, it takes its value from from the intended use cases would do. Defaults to
            ``False``.
        can (bool): Whether to cache the ``can`` phase of the file, if its
            format uses it. If ``bool``, it overrides what the intended use cases would do. If
            ``None``, it takes its value from from the intended use cases would do. Defaults to
            ``False``.
