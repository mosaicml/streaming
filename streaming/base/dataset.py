class StreamingDataset(Array, IterableDataset):
    """A mid-epoch-resumable streaming/caching pytorch IterableDataset.

    Features elastically deterministic shuffling, which enables fast mid-epoch resumption.

    Checkpoints are represented in JSON as follows:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "epoch" :"int",
            "sample_in_epoch": "int",
            "shuffle_seed": "int",

        }

    StreamingDataset init takes two kinds of arguments:

    * What to iterate:

      * One or more streams (you must provide either ``streams`` or ``remote``/``local``):

        * ``streams``
        * ``remote``
        * ``local``

      * Knobs to control streaming behavior, which, if multiple streams are provided,
        become defaults applied to each of them:

        * ``split``
        * ``download_retry``
        * ``download_timeout``
        * ``validate_hash``
        * ``keep_zip``

      * Absolute dataset size, if streams were weighted relatively:

        * ``epoch_size``

    * How to iterate:

      * Shard lifecycle:

        * ``predownload``
        * ``cache_limit``

      * Sampling:

        * ``sampling_method``
        * ``sampling_granularity``

      * Determinism:

        * ``partition_algo``
        * ``num_canonical_nodes``
        * ``batch_size``

      * Shuffling:

        * ``shuffle``
        * ``shuffle_algo``
        * ``shuffle_seed``
        * ``shuffle_block_size``

      * Batching:

        * ``batching_method``


    Args:
        streams (Sequence[Stream], optional): One or more streams to stream/cache samples from,
            which may be upsampled or downsampled. StreamingDataset uses either ``streams`` or
            ``remote``/``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        remote (str, optional): Remote path or directory to download the dataset from. If ``None``,
            its data must exist locally. StreamingDataset uses either ``streams`` or
            ``remote``/``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        local (str, optional): Local working directory to download shards to. This is where shards
            are cached while they are being used. Uses a temp directory if not set.
            StreamingDataset uses either ``streams`` or ``remote``/``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        split (str, optional): Which dataset split to use, if any. If provided, we stream from/to
            the ``split`` subdirs of  ``remote`` and ``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        download_retry (int): Number of download re-attempts before giving up. Defaults to ``2``.
        download_timeout (float): Number of seconds to wait for a shard to download before raising
            an exception. Defaults to ``60``.
        validate_hash (str, optional): Optional hash or checksum algorithm to use to validate
            shards. Defaults to ``None``.
        keep_zip (bool): Whether to keep or delete the compressed form when decompressing
            downloaded shards. If ``False``, keep iff remote is local or no remote. Defaults to
            ``False``.
        epoch_size (Union[int, str], optional): Number of samples to draw per epoch balanced
            across all streams. If ``None``, takes its value from the total number of underlying
            samples. Provide this field if you are weighting streams relatively to target a larger
            or smaller epoch size. Defaults to ``None``. Can also take in human-readable number
            abbreviations (e.g., ``"100k"``, ``"64M"``, ``"77b"``, etc). Defaults to ``None``.
        predownload (int, optional): Target number of samples to download per worker in advance
            of current sample. Workers will attempt to download ahead by this many samples during,
            but not before, training. Recommendation is to provide a value greater than per device
            batch size to ensure at-least per device batch size number of samples cached locally.
            If ``None``, its value gets derived using per device batch size and number of
            canonical nodes ``max(batch_size, 256 * batch_size // num_canonical_nodes)``.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        cache_limit (Union[int, str], optional): Maximum size in bytes of this StreamingDataset's
            shard cache. Before downloading a shard, the least recently used resident shard(s)
            may be evicted (deleted from the local cache) in order to stay under the limit.
            Set to ``None`` to disable shard eviction. Supports integer bytes as well as string
            human-readable bytes (e.g., ``100b``, ``64kb``, ``77mb``, and so on). Defaults to
            ``None``.
        sampling_method (str): Which sampling method to use, either ``balanced`` or ``fixed``.
            Defaults to ``balanced``.
        sampling_granularity (int): When picking samples for a stream's final partial repeat,
            how many samples to pick from the same shard at a time (``1`` for evenly balanced
            across shards, ``1000`` to pick 1000 samples from the same shard at a time, etc).
            Defaults to ``1``.
        partition_algo (str): Which partitioning algorithm to use. Defaults to ``orig``.
        num_canonical_nodes (int, optional): Canonical number of nodes for shuffling with
            resumption. The sample space is divided evenly according to the number of canonical
            nodes. The higher the value, the more independent non-overlapping paths the
            StreamingDataset replicas take through the shards per model replica (increasing data
            source diversity). Defaults to ``None``, which is interpreted as 64 times the number
            of nodes of the initial run.

            .. note::

                For sequential sample ordering, set ``shuffle`` to ``False`` and
                ``num_canonical_nodes`` to the number of physical nodes of the initial run.
        batch_size (int, optional): Batch size of its DataLoader, which affects how the dataset is
            partitioned over the workers. Defaults to ``None``.
        shuffle (bool): Whether to iterate over the samples in randomized order. Defaults to
            ``False``.
        shuffle_algo (str): Which shuffling algorithm to use. Defaults to ``py1s``.
        shuffle_seed (int): Seed for deterministic data shuffling. Defaults to ``9176``.
        shuffle_block_size (int): Unit of shuffle. A canonical node's samples are split into blocks
            of this size, and samples within each block are shuffled. Defaults to ``1 << 18``.
        batching_method (str): Which batching method to use, either ``random``, ``stratified``, or
            ``per_stream``. Defaults to ``random``.
