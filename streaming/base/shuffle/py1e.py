"""Shuffling algorithm that shuffles intra-shard in one place.

This algorithm is roughly twice as fast as algorithm ``py2s``, and ever so slightly biased.

Bias in this case merely refers to how we assign samples when we split shards at canonical node
boundaries, which is non-random in this algorithm. In practice, we found this does not matter to
convergence, while making us faster.

        seed (int): Base random seed, which is held constant over an entire training run.
        epoch (int): Current epoch, which is added to the seed to get a different deterministic
            shuffle each epoch.
