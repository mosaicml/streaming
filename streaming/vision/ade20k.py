class StreamingADE20K(StreamingDataset):
    """Implementation of the ADE20K dataset using StreamingDataset.

    Args:
        remote (str, optional): Remote path or directory to download the dataset from. If ``None``,
            its data must exist locally. StreamingDataset uses either ``streams`` or
            ``remote``/``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        local (str, optional): Local working directory to download shards to. This is where shards
            are cached while they are being used. Uses a temp directory if not set.
            StreamingDataset uses either ``streams`` or ``remote``/``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        split (str, optional): Which dataset split to use, if any. If provided, we stream from/to
            the ``split`` subdirs of  ``remote`` and ``local``. Defaults to ``None``.
        download_retry (int): Number of download re-attempts before giving up. Defaults to ``2``.
        download_timeout (float): Number of seconds to wait for a shard to download before raising
            an exception. Defaults to ``60``.
        validate_hash (str, optional): Optional hash or checksum algorithm to use to validate
            shards. Defaults to ``None``.
        keep_zip (bool): Whether to keep or delete the compressed form when decompressing
            downloaded shards. If ``False``, keep iff remote is local or no remote. Defaults to
            `False``.
        keep_raw (bool): Whether to keep or delete the decompressed form (or only form)
            of shards after all their samples have been yielded this epoch. If ``False``, keep iff
            remote is local or no remote and no compression. Defaults to ``True``.
        samples_per_epoch (int, optional): Provide this field iff you are weighting sub-datasets
            proportionally. Defaults to ``None``.
        predownload (int, optional): Target number of samples ahead to download the shards of while
            iterating. Defaults to ``100_000``.
        partition_algo (str): Which partitioning algorithm to use. Defaults to ``orig``.
        num_canonical_nodes (int, optional): Canonical number of nodes for shuffling with
            resumption. Defaults to ``None``, which is interpreted as the number of nodes of the
            initial run.
        batch_size (int, optional): Batch size of its DataLoader, which affects how the dataset is
            partitioned over the workers. Defaults to ``None``.
        shuffle (bool): Whether to iterate over the samples in randomized order. Defaults to
            ``False``.
        shuffle_algo (str): Which shuffling algorithm to use. Defaults to ``py1s``.
        shuffle_seed (int): Seed for Deterministic data shuffling. Defaults to ``9176``.
        joint_transform (callable, optional): A function/transforms that takes in an image and a
            target  and returns the transformed versions of both. Defaults to ``None``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in an image and returns a
            transformed version. Defaults to ``None``.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the target and
            transforms it. Defaults to ``None``.
